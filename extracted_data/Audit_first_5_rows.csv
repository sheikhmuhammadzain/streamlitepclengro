Finding /Recommendations must be added in GENERAL RESULTS,Insurance Survey Audit,,,"It was observed that maintenance KPIs have improved since previous visit, but do not adequately show site management current risk position when compared to best-in-class performance. Survey team was unable to easily see number of overdue SCD PMs, CMs, on-hold items and open notifications which are not yet work orders. The risk is that site management cannot effectively be aware if the current risk level changes, or if today’s risk level is acceptable. This may lead to under resourcing of this critical department and subsequent losses occurring. ; It was observed that permits: Are currently stored outside, not immediately accessible at the work-front or the CCR. Permits are not cross referenced to an isolation diagram. The risk is that: Workers are not able to easily refer to the permit during the task. CCR/ERT is not able to quickly understand impact of operational change or incident on active permits. Workers using a permit may not be clear on energy isolation in-place and will be unable to verify current isolation standard vs. requirement. For example, losses have occurred due to wrong flanges being broken. Permit management was a key factor in the Piper Alpha disaster (to this day, the largest PD loss in history). For complex isolations, there may be multiple work fronts which need to be closed prior to re-isolation. Cross referencing is essential for operations to confirm suitability to re-energize system.; It was observed that on the A-300 Furnace isolation plan, a spool removal was not captured on the isolation plan. In addition, the operations team had removed a spool, which was marked as a blind location on the isolation plan. The risk is that an error could be made when returning the isolated system back into operations, due to the isolation plan not reflecting the actual status of the system and the isolations in place. This risk increases with more complex isolation plans where the plan does not reflect the status in the field. This could lead to a LOPC event during re-energization of the system and a potential fire / explosion – ignition of a gas leak is very likely for furnace area LOPC. ; It was observed that there is currently a utility pump running, feeding into the firewater circuit for non-emergency use process water on site. Site shared that this was acceptable via current practices as the firewater pumps are not being used, despite excess capacity of the F/W main being used. The risk is that the additional hydraulic constraint on the system reduces the maximum attainable flow through the firewater system. In the event of a fire scenario, it is unlikely that process water use will be stopped as priority will be on emergency response. However, the maximum use case may not be possible, impacting firefighting effectiveness and exacerbating the loss. ; It was observed that, the site permit audits did not highlight items identified in 23.02 and 23.03. Given that only a single permit was reviewed during the survey and gaps vs. best-in-class performance were found it suggests that the site auditing system should be routinely finding gaps and driving improvements. However, it was communicated that there were no permit audit findings of note in 2022. The risk is that the site does not organically improve the permit standards above the site current position. An effective auditing system should drive continuous improvement towards best-in-class performance.","Maintenance; Health, Safety and Environment; Health, Safety and Environment; Process - UTY and PP; Health, Safety and Environment",C2 - Serious; C3 - Severe; C3 - Severe; C2 - Serious; C3 - Severe,0
